## MIMIC-III Benchmarks IHM Occlusion Analysis

Explainability in AI is a crucial research field, particularly in the biomedical domain where results derived from machine-learning models could help to make important decisions for hospitals.

In this repository, we conduct an occlusion (perturbation) analysis of the MIMIC-III benchmarks best in-hospital-mortality (IHM) model. The MIMIC-III benchmark model(s) are detailed in an upstream repository [here](https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks), which is distributed under the MIT [License](./THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt).

### 1. Dependencies

**i.** In order to set up this repository, we would need to satisfy local pythonic dependencies. If `poetry` is installed on your system, you can install dependencies and create a virtual environment automatically via the following command:

```shell
$ poetry install
```

Alternatively, you can install dependencies with `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: Your python version must be `3.7.*` in order to install certain dependencies in this repository. 

**ii.** In this repository, we use `R` and `ggplot` for visualization. Execute the following within your R console to get the dependencies:

```r
> install.packages(c("ggplot2","tikzDevice","reshape2","optparse"))
```

**Note:** R-scripts were tested with R version `3.6.*`.

### 2. Repository initialization

In order to populate this repository with the necessary data, follow these steps:

**i.** Clone the `MIMIC-III` benchmarks [repository](https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks) and initialize input data for the In-Hospital-Mortality (IHM) task. This process can take a long period of time and also requires the user to undertake a medical ethics examination in order to download the `MIMIC-III` raw data.

**ii.** After processing the IHM data, create a symlink from the `MIMIC-III` benchmark IHM data to `./data` in order to access the data in this repository:

```shell
$ cd ./data && ln -s {path-to-mimic3-repo}/data/in-hospital-mortality/ .
```

**iii.** Next, run `init.sh` in order to set up some final features:

```shell
$ ./init.sh
```

**iv**. The first prompt will ask if you want to initialize a pre-commit hook for keeping python-dependencies up-to-date. If you aim to further develop this repository, then answer yes for this prompt.

**v.** The next prompt will ask if you want to download and deploy the best `MIMIC-III` benchmark models. Answer yes for this, as this step is necessary.

### 3. Occlusion pipeline

In order to conduct occlusion on the `MIMIC-III` benchmark IHM dataset, we developed functions within `occlude.py`. We provide code for four types of occlusion; namely zero, normal-value, inner and outer occlusion. Details regarding each of these occlusions can be found in the py-docstring documentation in `occlude.py`. Below is a usage script:

```
$ python3 occlude.py --help

usage: occlude.py [-h] [--occlusion-type str] [--n-iterations int]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --occlusion-type str  type of occlusion to conduct, either 'zero', 'normal-
                        value', 'inner', 'outer' or 'all' (default: all)

arguments specific to inner/outer occlusion:
  --n-iterations int    number of permutation iterations for inner/outer
                        occlusion (default: 5)
```

An example of running this script would be:

```shell
$ python3 occlude.py --occlusion-type all --n-iterations 10
```

This pipeline will compute original and occluded model scores and will output them as `csv` files within the `./output` directory.

### 4. Visualization

In order to visualize the results from the `csv` files, simply run the following:

```shell
$ Rscript vis.R
```

The corresponding visualizations will be converted to latex code within the `tikz` framework and will then be saved as pdf's in the `./img` directory.

**Note:** This requires all the corresponding `csv` files to be present.

### 5. Interpretation

Based on the results of the perturbation, we can already interpret some interesting results. Below, we have one of the visualizations produced from the step before.

This visualization shows nominal perturbations recorded during occlusion. `normal-value` on the top-right refers to replacing features of interest marginally by their `normal-value` or healthy values, which were suggested by medical experts. We shall focus on `normal-value` occlusion for this interpretation.

Most features show non-clustered and generally widely distributed perturbations. The exception are the `presence*` features, which are binary features which indicate `1` when the feature was present in the timestep and `0` if the feature was absent during the timestep and needed to be imputed.

For the `presence*` features, we assumed the `normal` values would be `1`, since in a normal scenario, all features should be recorded for all timesteps. By doing this, we can see significant and clustered perturbations for the `presence*` features.

In particular, we can see that if (by chance) more `capillary_refill_rate` measurements were taken (such that `capillary_refill_rate` did not need to be imputed), the model's prediction probability for mortality decreases significantly. This could pose a risk of false negatives for mortality.
